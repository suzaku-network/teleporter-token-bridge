 * @dev Abstract contract that helps implement reentrancy guards for Teleporter token bridge {_send} and {_sendAndCall}

 *
 * The send methods must not allow reentry given that can make calls to external contracts such as {safeTransferFrom}
 * and {safeDeposit}. However, the send methods should be allowed to be called from {receiveTeleporterMessage}, either
 * as a part of processing a multi-hop transfer, or as a part of an external call made to process a "sendAndCall"
 * message.
